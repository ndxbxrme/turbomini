# Middleware Guard

## What it demonstrates
- Route-level guards with `app.addMiddleware()`.
- Cancelling navigation by returning `false`.
- Keeping guard state in a shared store.

## Run it
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:4173/` in your browser.
Note: the docs site hosts examples under `/turbomini/examples/<name>/`, but local dev serves from the root.

## Test it
```bash
npm test
```
